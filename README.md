# Flutter Matter Plugin
This plugin enables you to commission, control and share matter devices.

It is developed as a [federated plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins), so it is seperated in the following packages:


1. [flutter_matter](/flutter_matter/): This is the app-facing package, which users depend on to use the plugin. This package specifies the API used by the Flutter app. For details see the [README.md](/flutter_matter/README.md).

2. [flutter_matter_android](/flutter_matter_android/): This package is the [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin) Android implementation.

3. [flutter_matter_ios](/flutter_matter_ios/): This package is the [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin) iOS implementation.

4. [flutter_matter_platfrom_interface](/flutter_matter_platfrom_interface/): A common platform interface for the `flutter_matter` plugin.
